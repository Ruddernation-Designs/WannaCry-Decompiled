# WannaCry|WannaDecrypt0r NSA-Cyberweapon-Powered Ransomware Worm 

* **Virus Name**: WannaCrypt, WannaCry, WanaCrypt0r, WCrypt, WCRY
* **Vector**: All Windows versions before Windows 10 are vulnerable if not patched for MS-17-010. It uses EternalBlue MS17-010 to propagate.
* **Ransom**: between $300 to $600. There is code to 'rm' (delete) files in the virus. Seems to reset if the virus crashes.
* **Backdooring**: The worm loops through every RDP session on a system to run the ransomware as that user. It also installs the DOUBLEPULSAR backdoor. It corrupts shadow volumes to make recovery harder. (source: malwarebytes)
* **Kill switch**: If the website `www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com` is up the virus exits instead of infecting the host. (source: malwarebytes). This domain has been sinkholed, stopping the spread of the worm. Will not work if proxied ([source](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/05/13/quickpost-wcry-killswitch-check-is-not-proxy-aware/)).

*update*: A minor variant of the virus has been found, it looks to have had the killswitch hexedited out. Not done by recompile so probably not done by the original malware author. On the other hand that is the only change: the encryption keys are the same, the bitcoin addresses are the same. On the other hand it is corrupt so the ransomware aspect of it doesn't work - it only propagates.

# Cryptography details

* Each infection generates a new RSA-2048 keypair.
* The public key is exported as blob and saved to 00000000.pky
* The private key is encrypted with the ransomware public key and saved as 00000000.eky
* Each file is encrypted using AES-128-CBC, with a unique AES key per file.
* Each AES key is generated CryptGenRandom.
* The AES key is encrypted using the infection specific RSA keypair.

The RSA public key used to encrypt the infection specific RSA private key is embedded inside the DLL and owned by the ransomware authors.

* https://haxx.in/key1.bin (the ransomware pubkey, used to encrypt the users private key)
* https://haxx.in/key2.bin (the dll decryption privkey)
the CryptImportKey() rsa key blob dumped from the DLL by blasty.

# File types

There are a number of files and folders wannacrypt will avoid. Some because it's entirely pointless and others because it might destabilize the system. During scans, it will search the path for the following strings and skip over if present:

*   "Content.IE5"
*   "Temporary Internet Files"
*   " This folder protects against ransomware. Modifying it will reduce protection"
*   "\Local Settings\Temp"
*   "\AppData\Local\Temp"
*   "\Program Files (x86)"
*   "\Program Files"
*   "\WINDOWS"
*   "\ProgramData"
*   "\Intel"
*   "$\"

The filetypes it looks for to encrypt are:

.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pst, .ost, .msg, .eml, .vsd, .vsdx, .txt, .csv, .rtf, .123, .wks, .wk1, .pdf, .dwg, .onetoc2, .snt, .jpeg, .jpg, .docb, .docm, .dot, .dotm, .dotx, .xlsm, .xlsb, .xlw, .xlt, .xlm, .xlc, .xltx, .xltm, .pptm, .pot, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx, .ppam, .potx, .potm, .edb, .hwp, .602, .sxi, .sti, .sldx, .sldm, .sldm, .vdi, .vmdk, .vmx, .gpg, .aes, .ARC, .PAQ, .bz2, .tbk, .bak, .tar, .tgz, .gz, .7z, .rar, .zip, .backup, .iso, .vcd, .bmp, .png, .gif, .raw, .cgm, .tif, .tiff, .nef, .psd, .ai, .svg, .djvu, .m4u, .m3u, .mid, .wma, .flv, .3g2, .mkv, .3gp, .mp4, .mov, .avi, .asf, .mpeg, .vob, .mpg, .wmv, .fla, .swf, .wav, .mp3, .sh, .class, .jar, .java, .rb, .asp, .php, .jsp, .brd, .sch, .dch, .dip, .pl, .vb, .vbs, .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .js, .asm, .h, .pas, .cpp, .c, .cs, .suo, .sln, .ldf, .mdf, .ibd, .myi, .myd, .frm, .odb, .dbf, .db, .mdb, .accdb, .sql, .sqlitedb, .sqlite3, .asc, .lay6, .lay, .mml, .sxm, .otg, .odg, .uop, .std, .sxd, .otp, .odp, .wb2, .slk, .dif, .stc, .sxc, .ots, .ods, .3dm, .max, .3ds, .uot, .stw, .sxw, .ott, .odt, .pem, .p12, .csr, .crt, .key, .pfx, .der

# Vulnerability disclosure

The specific vulnerability that it uses to propagate is ETERNALBLUE.

This was developed by "equation group" an exploit developer group associated with the NSA and leaked to the public by "the shadow brokers". Microsoft fixed this vulnerability March 14, 2017. They were not 0 days at the time of release.
